            desription: `Crypto market cap is the total value of all the coins of a particular cryptocurreny
                that have been mined or are in circulation. Market capitalization is used to determine the 
                ranking of cryptocurrencies. The higher the market cap of a particular crypto coin, the higher 
                its ranking and share of the market. Crypto market cap is calculated by multiplying the total 
                number of coins in circulation by its current price. For instance, to calculate the market cap of
                Ethereum, all you need to do is multiply the total number of Ethereum in circulation by the current
                price of one Ethereum and you will get its market cap.`

            title: 'How to compare Cryptocurrencies Market Cap?',
            desription: `As a financial metric, market cap allows you to compare the total circulating value of one
                cryptocurrency with another. Large cap cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have a market 
                cap of over $10 billion. They typically consist of protocols that have demonstrated track records, 
                and have a vibrant ecosystem of developers maintaining and enhancing the protocol, as well as 
                building new projects on top of them. While market cap is a simple and intuitive comparison metric, 
                it is not a perfect point of comparison. Some cryptocurrency projects may appear to have inflated 
                market cap through price swings and the tokenomics of their supply. As such, it is best to use this 
                metric as a reference alongside other metrics such as trading volume, liquidity, fully diluted 
                valuation, and fundamentals during your research process.`

                Ethereum is $15 billion, it means that $15 billion worth of Ether had changed hands across all
